## Steps on How to Create GitHub Page

For this exercise, I clone the public repository given for the exercise. Thereafter, I create files needed such as the README.md and those needed like for this one, index.html file. After that I can add, commit, and push changes.

## Key Takeaways from this Exercise

In this week's exercise, I'm able to use github more efficiently in commiting and making sure that I don't lose track of my codes
especially when it becomes too lengthy already. I am able to edit current file while being able to look back at pat versions of my code simultaneously.
